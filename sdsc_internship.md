# SDSC Internship
I am currently interning at the San Diego Supercomputer Center, specifically under the [WIFIRE](https://wifire.ucsd.edu/) project, doing work with data handling and machine learning related to the performance of the [BurnPro3D](https://wifire.ucsd.edu/burnpro3d) tool. Simply put, BurnPro3D is a tool for simulating how controlled burns would play out given a terrain and weather conditions.
