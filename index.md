## About Me
Hello, I'm Ravi, a third year Computer Science major at UCSD. I hope to graduate in Spring 2025, then pursue a Masters in Computer Science. After university, I plan to become a Software Engineer. For information on my hard skills and relevant work, check out my [experience and preferences](#experience-and-preferences) or my [further work](#further-work).

Here are some of my recent/current goals:
  [x] Work for an internship using programming to do useful, research-oriented work.
  [ ] Continue improving my coding/software development habits.
  [ ] Get into a Master's Computer Science program at UCSD.


For me, one of the most important factors in a large project is code readability and documentation.

## Experience and Preferences
I most commonly code in Python, but I am also familiar with the following **languages**:
- C, C++
- Java
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Here are a few **tools** I am comfortable using:
1. Git, github
2. Vim
3. Command line


## Further Work
Outside of school, I do most of my coding for an internship at SDSC (San Diego Supercomputer Center). You can find more information on that [here](sdsc_internship.md). Find my github repository for that project [here](https://github.com/ravishende/grafana_data_retrieval). Feel free to `git clone` the repository and run `python3 main.py` for real time performance data on active BurnPro3D runs.
